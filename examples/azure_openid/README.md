# Okta OpenID Connect example

## Requirements

Needs:

* sanic
* sanic-jinja2
* sanic-session
* sanic-openid-connect-provider

## Okta Requirements

You need the authorisation server, looks like `https://dev-999999.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/` - trailing slash as we append `.well-known/openid-configuration`

An application created, using the `Authorization Code` flow. You'll need the Client ID and Client secret from this app. You'll also need 
to configure the login redirect URI. In this example it is `http://localhost:8006/callback`

## Running the example

To run the example you need to provide the following environment variables when running `server.py`

* AZURE_CLIENT_ID - App client ID
* AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET - App client secret
* AZURE_BASE - https://dev-999999.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/

Then goto http://localhost:8006, there will be a link to a protected page, when clicked you'll be send to okta for authentication (seamless if your
already logged in) and then redirected back to a callback page which deals with the Okta response. The page will then load and you'll see a json
representation of the entire session, the part your interested in is `request['session']['user']`

Should see logging similar to this:
